<h2>Abstract</h2><span class="markdown">
<p>This ontology puts together all the ontology modules and ODPs that form the PFEEPSA (Poultry Farm Energy Efficiency Prediction Semantic Assistant) Ontology.</p>

<p>The PFEEPSA ontology was developed in the context of the <a href="https://www.iof2020.eu/">IoF2020</a> H2020 project, with the aim of capturing all the necessary knowledge to support data analysts in the development of a system that warns farmers about potential future situations which may be uncomfortable or even harmful for animals.</p>
